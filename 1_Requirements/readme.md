# Requirements
## Introduction
A calculator is a device which performs calculations like addition, subtraction etc. In this project the calculations are performed using a command line interface.

## Research
The calculator has been evolving. The electronic calculators of the mid-1960s were large and heavy desktop machines due to their use of hundreds of transistors on several circuit boards with a large power consumption that required an AC power supply. Nowadays calculators are light weight and perform calculations quickly. Super computers have come which can calculate in 1 second what would take 6 billion years.

## Cost and features
The features of this project are:
* Addition : The addition Add() function takes two operands as input and the function results in a+b.
* Subtraction : The subtraction Sub() function takes two operands as input and the function results in a-b.
* Multiplication : The multiplication Mul() function takes two operands as input and the function results in a*b.
* Division : The division Div() function takes two operands as input and the function results in a/b.

The cost will depend on what components the calculator is built and it's speed.
